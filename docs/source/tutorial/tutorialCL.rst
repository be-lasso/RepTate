RepTate Command Line Tutorial
=============================

Examples of use of Reptate using the Command Line interpreter and batch.

Tutorial files can be found in the **tests** folder. They can be run in batch mode or in interactive mode. 

- To run them in **interactive** mode, introduce the lines in the file (except the comments, which start with ``#`` and the line ``console batch``) one by one and wait for the results.

- To run them in **batch** mode, you can execute ``RepTate.py -b < tutorial\TEST_WLFShift.txt`` (or your tutorial of choice) and the output will be shown in the command line. In batch mode, no graphs or plots are shown.
