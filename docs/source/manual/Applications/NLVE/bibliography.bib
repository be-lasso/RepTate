@article{Mishler2013,
abstract = {The new diluted stretch tube polydisperse MLD " toy" model developed in Part I is used to simulate experimental data for a " spiked" and " unspiked" polydisperse polystyrene melt with a broad molecular weight distribution in transient uniaxial, planar and bi-axial extensional flows [1-3]. The new model is in good agreement with experimental data sets in transient stretching flows whereas the original " na{\"{i}}ve" polydisperse MLD " toy" model without incorporation of the new physics completely fails to capture salient features of stretching flows, such as strain hardening, of these broadly polydisperse systems. Quantitative analysis of the apparent distinctions in material response between different types of transient extensional flow is performed in terms of the new polydisperse MLD diluted stretch tube model. Results of this analysis quantitatively explain why uniaxial extension is the most strain hardening and bi-axial extension is the least strain hardening extensional flow thereby resolving this long standing and previously enigmatic issue. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Minegishi2001,
abstract = {Melt rheology of blends consisting of tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene (Teflon{\textregistered} FEP) copolymer and a small amount of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon{\textregistered} PTFE) has been studied under shear and uniaxial elongational deformations. The blends were prepared in a twin-screw kneader at 320°C. Compatibility of the components was investigated by DSC measurements, resulting in two separated peaks for the blends, which suggested FEP and PTFE were mixed in immiscible state. Structural observations were performed with optical microscope and SEM. It was clearly observed that PTFE uniaxialy elongated like fibril by kneading with FEP, and dispersed relatively uniformly in FEP. Storage modulus G' and complex viscosity $\eta$* toward lower frequency region became larger by increasing a loading of PTFE in dynamic shear measurements. The blends showed the strain-hardening property in uniaxial elongational measurements, whose tendency became stronger by increasing a loading of PTFE, though FEP hardly showed strain-hardening property. The results would be explained by the idea that dispersed PTFE fibril deformed during an elongational deformation and then generated a contractile stress, which would be resulted from that long length of dispersed PTFE and a strong adhesive interaction of interfaces between PTFE and FEP.},

@article{Blackwell2000,
abstract = {The "pom-pom" model of McLeish and Larson [J. Rheol. 42, 81-110 (1998)] provides a simple molecular theory for the nonlinear rheology of long chain branched polymer melts. A feature of this model is a maximum stretch for the branched molecules. Sharp transitions were predicted in the extensional viscosity at this maximum stretch. We introduce a simple treatment of the coupling between relaxed and unrelaxed polymer segments at branch points. The branch point is allowed to move in a quadratic localizing potential of unknown strength. Taking account of this effect smoothes the sharp transitions of the model and accounts for the extensional viscosity of "pom-pom" model polymers at their maximum stretch. The result is an improved multimode pom-pom fit for low-density polyethylene rheology. By fitting the nonlinear extensional viscosity, quantitative predictions are made for the nonlinear steady shear viscosity and transient first normal stress difference in shear. {\textcopyright} 2000 The Society of Rheology.},

@article{Read2003,
abstract = {We obtained the molecular weight and long chain branching distribution for polyolefins made with a combination of two single-site metallocene catalysts in a CSTR. Long chain branches are assumed to be formed by the incorporation of chains formed with a double bond end (macromers) at the catalyst sites. In the case where one of the catalysts produces only linear chains, we obtain explicit expressions for both the bivariate molecular weight and branching distribution, and the overall molecular weight distribution. In the general case where both catalysts incorporate branches, we are unable to obtain an explicit expression, but we can define a recusive algorithm which rapidly gives exact results for these two distributions. We compare the distributions with results from a more conventional population balance on the same system. We also obtain recursive algorithms for the statistical distribution of the topological variables seniority and priority for this general case, illustrating how they change with the reactor variables.},
