This theory is intended for the prediction of non-linear transient flows of linear entangled polymers. The model includes the contribution from contour length fluctuations, reptation, retraction, constraint release and variable number of entanglements. For full details about how the predictions are calculated, refer to :cite:`NLVE-Graham2003`.
