**The React module**

The React module allows the viewing of experimental gpc-light scattering data. It also
provides theories for the modelling of such data. At present, all the theories
in the module are based on the use of Monte Carlo reaction simulations, which
produce a representative set of molecules and which are then statistically
analysed to produce molecular weight distributions. These simulations can then be
mixed together, in a "Mixture" theory, to produce new distributions. The
molecules, once generated, can be saved into a polymer configuration file
suitable for rheology prediction using the "BoB" software.

The React module provides a number of different ways of plotting the data, and
also the possibility of viewing several graphs at once. To change the view of
a particular graph, click on the relevant tab on the side of the graphs panel.
Then change its view. Now, clicking the "All" tab should return to the
three-graphs display with the view of the relevant graph changed.

#.  Start RepTate and create a new React Application |Reactapp|:

#.  Drag and drop a file with a `.reac` extension, e.g. `out1.reac` in the `data/React/` folder.

    The 4 columns of the file should contain (1) the molecular mass :math:`M`, (2) the 
    relative molecular weight :math:`w(\log(M))`, (3) the :math:`g`-factor, 
    and (4) the number of branching per 1000 carbon.
    The :math:`g`-factor is defined as

    .. math::
        g = \dfrac{\langle R^2_g \rangle_\text{branched}}{\langle R^2_g \rangle_\text{linear}},
    
    where :math:`\langle R^2_g \rangle_\text{linear}` is the radius of
    gyration squared of a linear molecule of the same chemistry and molecular
    weight as a given branched molecule.

#.  Select a theory, e.g. the "Tobita Batch" theory |TobitaBatchTh|, and press |einstein| to create it.

    Note that automatic "minimisation" |minimisation| is disabled for all theories 
    in the React application because they are based on Monte Carlo simulations. 
    Hence, minimisation seems a risky and time-consuming business.
